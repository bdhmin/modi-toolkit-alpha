This is a stepping stone towards the long-term vision of elevating graphical interfaces for computation up to a global, operating system-wide functionality. You should be able to compute on everything you see.\nI enjoy discussing programming UIs, programming pain points, and the future of programming.',

    longBio: 'Bryan Min is a PhD student in the Creativity Lab. He is interested in giving end-users more control over their interface. End-users should be able to easily, expressively, and broadly customize their interface, without complex code or searching for settings in a bloated settings panel. Bryan explores novel interaction techniques in foundational design patterns that gives end-users this control to customize their interface. These techniques could either be supported by direct manipulation or natural language queries to AI. Bryan studied computer science in UC San Diego as an undergraduate student.',
